## Header Image Tips

For the city skyline header (`header-skyline.png`):

1. **Dimensions**: Wide aspect ratio works best (e.g., 1200x300, 1400x350)
2. **Dark overlay**: Add a semi-transparent dark overlay (50-70% opacity black) to make your name pop
3. **Optional green tint**: Add a subtle green (#00FF41) gradient or glow at the bottom for cohesion
4. **Compression**: Keep file size under 1MB for fast loading

### Quick edit in any image editor:
1. Open your skyline photo
2. Add a layer with black fill, set opacity to 60%
3. Optionally add a green-to-transparent gradient at bottom
4. Export as PNG

## Image Guidelines

For the dark theme aesthetic:

1. **Logos** - Use transparent PNGs with green (#00FF41) or white elements on transparent background
2. **Screenshots** - Dark mode screenshots work best. Consider adding a subtle green border or glow
3. **File format** - PNG for logos (transparency), PNG or WebP for screenshots

## How to Add Images

1. Save your images to this folder with the exact names above
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. The README will automatically display them

## Quick Test

After adding images, your profile will show them. If an image doesn't load:
- Check the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure the file is committed and pushed
- Verify the image isn't corrupted
